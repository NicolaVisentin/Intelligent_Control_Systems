# Intelligent Control of a 2-links Robotic Arm

Implementation of intelligent control and machine learning techniques for various
identification and control tasks on a 2-links robotic arm using Python. Configuration
estimation from images with Convolutional Neural Networks. Lagrangian Neural
Networks, Iterative Learning Control and Gaussian Process Regression for learning
the dynamics/control of the system.
